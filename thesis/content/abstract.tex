\chapter{Abstract}

Get a parareal solver running with column compression.
The tricky part is that the interface solutions (solutions at time slice bounds) differ in size,
\wrt both storage requirements and matrix dimensions.

\section*{Working Titles}
\todo[inline]{Choose title}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A Low-Rank Parareal [Solver|Method] for DRE
  \item A Massively Parallel [Solver|Method] for Large-Scale DRE
  \item DRE = [Matrix[-Valued]] Differential [Matrix] Riccati [Matrix] Equations

    (choose one)
  \item DRE = Differential Riccati Equations

    (as \enquote{low-rank} somehow implies \enquote{matrix-valued})
  \item ... written in Julia
\end{enumerate}
