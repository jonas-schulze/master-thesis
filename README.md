# Playground

* playing with ParaReal and DifferentialRiccatiEquations
* sharing data with Mechthild

## MATLAB/Octave Setup

Needs to be done once (fingers crossed):

* `MATLABPATH=$MATLABPATH:$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/src/m`
* Run `addpath('src/m'); savepath` from within the project's toplevel directory
